- How FOSS and Web3 Align
- Web3’s Boost to FOSS: Finance & Economy
- Incentivizing Developers with Web3
- Where Web3 Falls Short
- Q&A and Discussion

# What is FOSS?

- **Free and Open Source Software**
- Software with source code available to use, study, modify, and distribute
- Core principles:
  - Freedom to run, modify, share
  - Community-driven development
- Examples: Linux, Firefox, VLC

# What is Web3?

- **Decentralized Web**
- Built on blockchain, smart contracts, and crypto
- Core principles:
  - Decentralization
  - Ownership via tokens/NFTs
  - Trustless systems
- Examples: Ethereum, IPFS, DAOs

# How FOSS and Web3 Align

- **Shared Ethos**
  - Openness: FOSS code is public; Web3 protocols are transparent
  - Community: Both rely on collective contribution
  - Anti-centralization: Resist control by single entities

- **Practical Overlaps**
  - Web3 projects often use FOSS tools (e.g., Ethereum’s open-source clients)
  - FOSS benefits from Web3’s decentralized hosting (e.g., IPFS)

# Web3’s Boost to FOSS: Finance & Economy

- **New Funding Models**
  - Tokenization: Raise funds via ICOs, DAOs
  - Crowdfunding: Direct support from users (e.g., Gitcoin Grants)
- **Sustainability**
  - FOSS projects historically struggle with funding
  - Web3 offers revenue streams beyond donations
- **Economic Empowerment**
  - Contributors earn tokens or crypto for their work
  - Global participation, no intermediaries

# Incentivizing Developers with Web3

- **Direct Rewards**
  - Tokens for commits, bug fixes, or features
  - Example: Radicle rewards contributors with governance tokens
- **Ownership Stake**
  - Developers become stakeholders in the project’s success
  - Aligns incentives with long-term growth
- **Global Access**
  - Crypto payments bypass banking barriers
  - Encourages diverse, international talent

# Where Web3 Falls Short

- **Incomplete FOSS Adoption**
  - Many Web3 projects are proprietary or semi-open
  - Focus on profit over openness
- **Licensing Bottlenecks**
  - Smart contracts and tokens often lack clear licenses
  - Conflicts with FOSS principles (e.g., MIT, GPL)

::right::

# More Challenges

- **Centralization Creep**
  - Web3 infra (e.g., Infura) can be centralized
  - Undermines FOSS decentralization goals
- **Speculation Over Utility**
  - Token hype distracts from software quality
  - Risk of “rug pulls” or abandonment

# Key Takeaways

- FOSS and Web3 share a vision of openness and decentralization
- Web3 enhances FOSS with funding and incentives
- But Web3 isn’t fully “FOSS” yet—licensing and priorities lag
- Opportunity: Bridge the gap for a stronger ecosystem

# Q&A and Discussion

- How can Web3 better embrace FOSS principles?
- What FOSS projects could benefit from Web3?
- Your thoughts and experiences?
